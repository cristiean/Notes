# Notes fromÂ *Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th ed.* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

## I. The interview process
- Ability to solve algorithmic problems you haven't seen before
	- Problem-solving questions (i.e. algorithm and coding problems)
- Talk out loud throughout the problem. Explain your thought process
	- The iterviewer might jump in to help. Let them
- Assessment may be based on the following:
	- Analytical skills:
		- Did it take you long to solve the problem?
		- How optimal was the solution?
		- How long did it take you to arrive at the solution?
		- If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
	- Coding skills:
		- Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
		- Was it clean and well-organised?
		- Did you think about potential errors?
		- Did you use good style?
	- Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals:
		- Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
	- Experience:
		- Have you made good technical decisions in the past?
		- Have you build interesting, challenging projects?
		- Have you shown drive, initiative and other important factors?
	- Culture fit / Communication:
		- Do your personality and values fit with the company and team?
		- Did you communicate well with your interviewer?
- The assessment is relative. How did you do at solving the same problem as other candidates tried to solve? The interviewer makes a judgement based on how good you were compared to other people they've seen. Of course this is not a rule.
- Whiteboards are used to abstract away the unnecessary aspects of code and for the candidate to have a chance of showing their thinking process.
- There are no 'recent Facebook' questions. The interviewers choose their own questions, and companies don't have lists of interview questions for every hiring season.
- This type of interview is not perfect, but it is what it is. Crack it!
- If you haven't heard back 3-5 business days after your interview, check in politely with your recruiter.
- You can re-apply after you've been rejected (usually after 6-12 months). A bad first interview usually won't affect a second interview. Lots of people got offers not after their first try.

## II. Behind the scenes
- Screening interview
	- Typically over the phone
	- Often involves coding and algorithms
	- May be had in an online coding environment, on paper, or emailing the code after the call.
	- There may even be 'home-work' involved.
- On-site interview
	- Usually 3 to 6 in-person interviews.
	- One of these is often over lunch. It is usually non-technical. It is a good opportunity to discuss your interests and ask about the company culture.
	- The rest of the interviews will involve: coding, algorithm, design/architecture and behavioural/experience questions.
- After the interview
	- Interviewers will provide feedback in some form
	- Interviewers meet together, or they send the feedback to a hiring manager, or another 
	- Most companies come back after about a week with next steps (offer, rejection, further interviews or just an update). If you have waited more than a week, follow up with your recruiter.

### The Microsoft Interview
- Microsoft wants smart people. Geeks. People who are passionate about technology.
- Usually you will arrive early in the morning an complete some paperwork
- Then, you will have a short technical interview that will ease you in for the 'real interview'
- During the first day you will do four or five interviews. 
- You'll meet with your Microsoft interviewers in their office. This is a good time to look around an get a feel for the team culture.
- Be nice to your recruiter. Your recruiter can be your biggest advocate, even pushing to re-interview you if you stumbled on your first interview. They can fight for you to be hired- or not!
- Definitely prepare: 'Why do you want to work for Microsoft?' In this question, Microsoft wants to see that you're passionate about technology. "I've been using MS for as long as I can remember... impressed at how Microsoft manages to create universal products... Visual Studio recently and the APIs are great!" shows a passion for technology.
- Unique: When you complete your interviews, you might speak to a hiring manager. If so, that's a great sign! It means you've passed the interviews with a particular team.

### The Amazon Interview
- Phone interview with a specific team
	- The engineer who interviews you will usually ask you to write simple code via a shared document editor.
	- They will also ask a broad set of questions to explore what areas of technology you're familiar with
- The next step is flying into the office you're interviewing for
	- Four or five interviews with one or two teams that have selected you based on your resume and phone interviews
	- Code on a whiteboard
	- Some interviewers will stress on other skills. Interviewers are assigned a specific area to probe.
	- They usually don't submit/discuss feedback until after all of the interviews
- The 'bar raiser' interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high. The interviewer in this case is well trained and has veto power. This interview might seem more difficult, but keep in mind that you are judged relative to other candidates.
- Definitely prepare: Amazon cares a lot about scale. Make sure you prepare for scalability questions. Also, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object-oriented design.
- Unique: The Bar Raiser is brought in from another team to keep the bar high. You need to impress both this person and the hiring manager.

## The Google Interview
- Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect technical questions.
	- May involve coding, sometimes via a shared document.
	- Typically same standard and similar questions as in on-site interviews.
- On-site interview: interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer.
	- Interviewer feedback is kept confidential from other interviewers.
	- You enter each interview with a blank slate.
	- Lunch interviewer does not submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity to ask honest questions.
- Interviewers are not given specific focuses. There is no 'structure' or 'system' to the interviews. Each interviewer conducts the interview as they like.
- Written feedback is submitted to a hiring committee of engineers and managers to make a hire / no-hire recommendation. The HC usually does not include any of your interviewers. 
- Feedback is typically broken down into four categories, and you are given a score from 1.0 to 4.0:
	- Analytical
	- Ability
	- Coding
	- Experience
	- Communication
- To extend an offer, the HC wants to see at least one interviewer who is an 'enthusiastic endorser'. So, a packet of scores of 3.6, 3.1, 3.1 and 2.6 is better than all 3.1s.
- You do not necessarily need to excel in every interview, and your phone screen performance is usually not a strong factor in the final decision.
- If the HC recommends an offer, your packet will go to a compensation committee and then to the executive management committee. Returning a decision can take several weeks due to these many stages.
- Definitely prepare:
	- As a web-based company, Google cares about how to design a scalable system. Google
	- Google puts a strong focus on analytical (algorithm) skills, regardless of experience. You should be very well prepared for these questions.
- Unique: Interviewers do not make the hiring decision. They enter feedback which is passed to a hiring committee.

## The Apple Interview
- Apple's interview has minimal beaureaucracy
- Interviewers will be looking for excellent technical skills, but a passion for the position and the company is also very important.
- You should be familiar with the Mac
- The first stage is usually a phone interview. This is to get a basic sense of your skills.
- The screening is followed-up by a series of technical phone screens with team members
- Once you're invited on campus, you'll typically be greeted by the recruiter who provides an overview of the process.
- You will have 6-8 interviews with members of the team which you're interviewing, as well as key people with whom your team works.
- Expect a mix of one-to-one and two-on-one interviews. Be ready to code on a whiteboard and make sure your thoughts are clearly communicated.
- Lunch is with your potential future manages and appears more casual, but it is still an interview.
- Each interviewer usually focuses on a different area and is discouraged from sharing feedback with other interviewers unless there's something they want to drill further into in subsequent interviews.
- Towards the end of the day, interviewers compare notes. If everyone feels you're a viable candidate, you'll have an interview with the director and the VP of the organisation to which you're applying.
- Definitely prepare: If you know the team you're interviewing for, make sure to read up on that product. What do you like about it? What would you improve?
- Unique: Two-on-one interviews are often at Apple. Also, Apple employees are huge Apple fans.

## The Facebook Interview
- Once selected, candidates will go through one or two phone screens. They will involve coding, usually in an online editor.
- After the phone interviews, you might be asked to do a homework assignment that will include a mix of coding and algorithms. Pay attention to your coding style here. If you've never worked in an environment which had thorough code reviews, it may be a good idea to get someone who has to review your code.
- During your on-site review, you will interview primarily with other software engineers. Hiring managers are also involved whenever they are available.
- Each interviewer is given a 'role' during the on-site interviews. This helps ensure that there are no repetitive questions and that they get a holistic picture of a candidate. The roles are:
	- Behavioural (Jedi): Assesses your ability to be successful in Facebook's environment. What are you excited about? How do you tackle challenges? Facebook wants passionate people, so talk about your interests. You might also be asked some coding questions in this interview
	- Coding and Algorithms (Ninja): Standard coding and algorithms questions. The questions are designed to be challenging. Use any programming language you want.
	- Design/Architecture (Pirate): For a backend software engineer, you might be asked system design questions. Front-end or other specialties will be asked design questions specific to that discipline. You should openly discuss different solutions and their tradeoffs.
- You can typically expect two 'Ninja' interviews and one 'Jedi' interview. Experienced candidates will also get a 'Pirate' interview.
- After your interviews, interviewers submit written feedback, prior to discussing your performance with each other.
- Once feedback is submitted, your interviewing team and a hiring manager get together to come to a decision. They submit their final hire decision to the hiring committee.
- Definitely prepare:
	- The youngest of the 'elite' companies, Facebook wants developers with an entrepreneurial spirit. In your interviews, you should show that you love to build stuff fast.
	- They want to know you can hack together an elegant and scalable solution using any language of choice.
Unique: Facebook interviews developers for the company 'in general', not for a specific team. If you are hired, you will go through a six-week 'bootcamp' which will help ramp you up in the massive code base. You'll get mentorship from senior devs, learn best practices, and get a greater flexibility in choosing a project than if you were assigned to a project in your interview.

## The Palantir Interview
- Palantir interviews for a specific team. You may be re-routed to another team where there is a better fit.
- Two phone interviews. 30-45 minutes long and primarily technical. A bit of prior experience, but heavy on algorithm questions.
- You might be sent a HackerRank coding assessment, which will evaluate your ability to write optimal algorithms and correct code. Less experienced candidates (college) are particularly likely to get such a test.
- Successful candidates are invited to campus and will interview with up to five people.
- Onsite interviews cover: your prior experience, relevant domain knowledge, data structures and algorithms, and design.
- You may also get a demo of Palantir's products. Ask good questions to demonstrate your passion for the company.
- Definitely prepare:
	- Palantir values hiring brilliant engineers. Many report that Palantir's questions were harder than they saw at other top companies.
	- You should learn your core data structures and algorithms inside and out. Then, focus on preparing with the hardest algorithm questions.
	- Brush up your system design if you're interviewing for a backend role.
- Unique: A coding challenge is common as part of Palantir's process. Although you'll have access to a computer, the questions can be extremely challenging. Algorithm efficiency will be evaluated. Prepare thoroughly (with online challenges like HackerRank)

## III. Special Situations
Note: In this section I have not went into details as it was not relevant to me. Feel free to read this chapter yourself should you wish to know more.

### Experienced Candidates
- Algorithm questions may appear more or less often in interviews for experienced candidates, depending on the company.
- Systems design and Architecture questions are much more probable to come up in experienced candidates' interviews. Recent graduates don't usually have much knowledge in this area due to lack of industry experience.
- Experienced candidates may also expect questions about their resume and about their experience (e.g. "What is the biggest bug you've faced?")

### Testers and SDETs (software design engineers in test)
- Testers require coding skills, and testing skills
- Prepare for testing problems
- Prepare for coding questions
- Prepare testing the coding questions
- Also, do not neglect the behavioural questions. Strong communication skills are very important for testers, as your job requires you to work with many different people.
- Career advice: If you are hoping to apply to an SDET position as the "easy" way into a company, be aware that many candidates find it difficult to change from an SDET position to a SD position. Keep your coding skills sharp and try to make the move in 1-2 years.

### Product (and Program) Management
- PM roles are higlhly varied. These are some of the aspects a PM should focus on when preparing for an interview:
	- Handling ambiguity
	- Customer focus (Attitude)
	- Customer focus (Technical skills)
	- Multi-level communication
	- Passion for technology
	- Teamwork / Leadership

### Dev Lead and Managers
- Strong coding skills are usually required for dev lead and manager roles. On top op that, a manager should focus on preparing:
	- Teamwork / Leadership
	- Prioritisation
	- Communication
	- "Getting things done"
- Ultimately, most of these stem from your prior experience and your personality. Prepare very, very thoroughly.

### Startups
- The application and interview process for startups is highly variable.
- The application process:
	- Many startups may post job listings, but the best way in is through personal refferal.
- Visas and Work Authorisation:
	- Many U.S. startups are unable to sponsor work visas.
- Resume selection factors:
	- Startups tend to look for candidates that not only know how to code well, but also work well in an entrepreneurial environment. 
	- Being able to "hit the ground running" is also important. They want people who already know the language of the company.
- The interview process:
	- Startups don't look only at software development skills
	- Personality fit: How do you interact with your interviewer?
	- Skill set: If you know the language that they work it, make sure to brush up on the details
	- Experience: Startups tend to ask lots of questions about your experience. Pay special attention to the Behaviuoural Questions section.

### Acquisitions and Acquihires
- Some aquisitions are made for the team (aquihires), some for the product, and others for the customer base / community.
- The aquired company's engineers are usually interviewed as part of the acquisition process.
- The interviews can make or break aquisitions. They determine which employees receive offers from the acquirer. They can also affect the acquisition price.
- Usually all engineers go through interviews for tech startup acquisitions.
- Sometimes interviews may not go well, but this may be judged on a case-by-case basis, and the outcomes vary.
- Employees from the acquired company are mostly held to the same standard as typical candidates. However, there might be a bit more leeway.

### For interviewers
