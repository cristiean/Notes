# Wealth of nations
### Introduction and Plan of the Work
- \[1\] *annual labour* of a nation - all the necessities and conveniences consumed in a year. These can be the produces themselves or whatever is bought with these produces from other nations.
- \[2\] this produce may be greater or smaller proportionally to the number of consumers.
- \[3\] this proportion must be regulated by:
    - skill, dexterity and judgement of the labour force
    - proportion between the employed in useful labour and the unemployed
-  \[4\] somehow the skill, dexterity and judgement of the labour force drives the supply of a nation to be much more abundant than savage nations. This allows people in the lowest orders to enjoy greater levels of comfort than savages.
- \[5\] The causes of this improvement and the order according to which the wealth is spread accross ranks of men in society is the subject of this First Book
- \[6\] a nation's supply must depend on theproportion of employed/unemployed. The number of useful and productive labourers is proportional to the quantity of capital stock employed in setting them to work, and the way this stock is used. The Second Book treats the nature of capital stock, the way in which it is accumulated and the different quantities of labour it puts into motions according to the ways in which it is employed.
- \[7\] the Third Book looks at the policies of applying skill, dexterity and judgement in different ways. For example, societies now focus on the arts, manufacturing, commerce and the industry of towns while in the Roman days they were focused on the industry of the country and agriculture.
- \[8\] the Fourth Book looks at different economic theories and their effects on society as a whole in different ages and nations.
- \[9\] the Fifth and last Book treats the revenue of the sovereign and the commonwealth. First, the expenses of the sovereign, or commonwealth, and which part of society should pay for them. Second, different methods of paying for these expenses. Third, governments mortgaging parts of this revenue and the effect of debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and the labour of society.

## Book I - Of the causes of improvement in the productive powers of labour, and of the order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks of the people
### Chapter I - Of the division of labour
- \[1\] The greater improvement in the productive powers of labour seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.
- \[2\] Large manufactures are easier to divide labour in. The greater the amount of people needing the supplies manufactured, the greater the number of workers. The greater the number of workers, the easiest it is to divide labour in divisions.
- \[3\] pin-making can be divided into many trades (line straightening, line cutting, etc.). Some people can do more than one operation. If a pin-maker would be to create a pin by themselves, they will probably not be able to even make one pin a day. 10 pin-makers can make many thousands of pins a day while 1 pin-maker can make but one. The division of labour renders every worker productive of thousands of pins a day each.
- \[4\] In most arts and manufactures the division of labour is implemented. In a more developed nation, the work of a man is worth as much as the work of 10 men in a less developed nation. Due to its seasonal nature, agriculture is harder to divide labour in as opposed to manufacture. Because of this, the agricultural produce of rich countries might not be much cheaper than the produce of poorer countries (as opposed to manufacture). Poland's, France's and England's corn all have the same price, while French fine silk is much cheaper than, say, England's (because of its manufacturing and resources). Manufactures are important for the subsistence of countries.
- \[5\] The increase in the quantity of work as a result of the division of labour has three reasons:
    - increase in the dexterity of every particular workman
    - saving the wasted time of shifting from one type of task to another
    - invention of machinery that facilitates and enchances labour, enabling one to do the work of many
- \[6\] First, on dexterity. Dexterity helps one do a task faster and better. The division of labour increases a worker's dexterity (with the tasks, tools and expertise needed for that task). Example of nail-making.
- \[7\] Second, switching tasks (activity, locus and tools) take a long time. When workers switch tasks their motivation plummets and hardly picks up. 
- \[8\] Third, aiding machines. Division of labour leads workers to focus solely on one task. By applying themselves to that task, workers usually find better, more efficient ways to do the work. Example given of the boy that has used a string to automate away his job as a fire-engine boiler-cylinder alternator. The boy ultimately wanted to save his own labour.
- \[9\] The improvements of machines have not been invented by their users, but by specialised men that are in the business of machine-making. Them, or philosophers or speculators, which are a class of workers in themselves. As with any other business, philosopers and speculators have their own trade and improve their dexterity and save time over time.
- \[10\] In a well-governed society, the surplus gained from the division of labour is spread accross workers which, in turn, is spread accross society. Therefore, the division of labour increases the standard of living of everyone in the society.
- \[11\] Point made about the division of labour being used in every area of manufacture, business and arts (probably in the sense of crafts). Every tool or item has employed many specialised men in its production. Also, a point is being made about a king's accommodation not being that much superior to a workmen's. Furthermore, the workmen's standard of living is much superior to that of African kings, who rule over thousands of people.
