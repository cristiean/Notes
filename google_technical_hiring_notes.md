## Applying to Google

### Resume

- Align skills and experiences with the internship or job description
- Be specific about projects you've worked on or managed
  - What was the outcome?
  - How did you measure success?
- Leadership role in volunteer organisation or part-time role?
  - How big was the team?
  - What was the scope of your work?
- Include GPA as well as other school-related projects or coursework that demonstrate skills and knowledge
- Keep it short. Aim for one page

### Prepare for the interview

- Series of interviews (telephone, video or in-person)
- For technical interviews, practice coding on a whiteboard, in Google Docs, or over the phone
  - Find sample questions on CodeLab, Quora, StackOverflow
  - Coding The Cracking Interview is also a good resource
- Structure interview answers
  - Important how you arrive at a solution, so think out loud

### Other questions to think about

- How do you work best, both as an individual and as part of a team?
- What challenges have you faced at school or at work and how did you overcome them?
- Which skills and experiences would be assets in the role and why?

## Google coding inverview

- Ask for clarifications:
  - What types are we expecting as input?
  - What do I need to return?
  - Are we expecting this edge case?
  - Is the given list sorted?
- Think out loud
- Don't write code right away. Think the solution through first
- Test your solution
- Think about edge cases

## Google hiring

- Browse jobs. Select those that you meet the minimum requirements for, and preferably some of the preferred qualifications

### Looking for 4 things:

#### General cognitive ability

- Smart people who can learn and adapt to new situations
- How you learn and solve hard problems in real life

#### Role related knowledge

- Experience, background and skills that will set you up for success in the role

#### Leadership

- Being a team player
- Navigating challenges to make an impact

#### Googliness

- Comfort with ambiguity
- Bias towards action
- Collaborative nature

## Interview tips from Software Engineers

- Interview structure:
  - A few warm-up questions
  - A main question that will take up the bulk of the interview (30-35 minutes)
- Have a good understanding of the data structures and algorithms
- Think out loud
  - Ask for clarifications
  - Call out assumptions
  - Explain thoughts clearly before starting to code
- Practice and get good at your chosen language
- Develop strong fundamentals
  - Use Google Tech Dev Guide
- Get used to coding on a whiteboard (or at least paper)
- You don't need to be an expert at high-level data structures, but you need to know all the basic ones really well

## Technical development for first and second year students

### First year
